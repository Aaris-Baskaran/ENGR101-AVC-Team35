Pseudo code

Variables:

vLeft:		    Speed of left motor – int 
vRight:	    	Speed of right motor – int
vForward:	    Constant speed of robot to go forward – int – 20 
vDifference:	Difference between motor speeds – int – not initialized
row:	      	Row number – int – 50
error:		    Distance of line from center – int – not initialized
arraySize:	  	Size of array – int – 150 
pixArray:	    Array to store luminance of pixels – int – size 150 
sumIndexes:		The sum of the values of the indexes with white pixels in the array – int – 0
count:			The number of white pixels in the array – int – 0


Functions:

isWhite(int pixelValue)
	-	Receives a number containing luminance value of a pixel, ranging from 0-255
	-	Returns an int
	-	Checks if the pixel is white (threshold is if value > 250)
	-	If white, return 1
	-	Else, return 0
	-	End function


findError(int arrayCenter, int lineCenter)
	-	Receives three numbers, the center of the array, the sum of indexes of white pixels in array, and the number of white pixels.
	-	Returns an int
	-	Finds the difference between the array center and the white line center
	-	And returns this value
	-	If there are no white pixels, then return 100, we could add a ‘Lost Mode’ to tell robot what to do if it leaves the white line.
	-	End function



main()
	-	Check if robot exists
	-	Initialize variables
	-	Main while loop for robot
		-	Take picture and save as PPM file. Do not change name of PPM file.
		-	For all columns in a fixed row, 
			-	Get luminance of pixel
			-	Convert this to 1 if it is white, 0 if not white
			-	Store this in the array of pixel values
			-	End for
		-	Calculate average value of the indexes of white pixels in the array – this value is the center of the white line
		-	Compare this to actual center of pixel values array
		-	Calculate the error – distance of line from center
		-	Calculate difference in speed of left and right motors
			-	Difference = k * error
		-	Calculate the right and left speeds of the motor according to error.
		-	Set speeds of motors to vForward +/- vDifference for right/left motor
		-	End while
	-	End main

To add: 
Lost mode
-	What to do if robot loses the line?
